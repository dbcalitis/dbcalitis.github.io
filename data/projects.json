{ "title": "Research Blog", "description": "A personal research blog, where I document my ongoing learning in cybersecurity. It serves as a space for exploring threats, security trends, and technical concepts through hands-on analysis and research. By breaking down complex topics and experimenting with different security techniques, I deepen my understanding while creating a resource I can revisit. Though primarily for personal growth, the blog also provides insights that may benefit others who share an interest in cybersecurity.", "link": "#blog", "image": "https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpngimg.com%2Fuploads%2Fsquare%2Fsquare_PNG35.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=dce4e2ceb22d7011020808aa346af6475635a4f452bff873e63394010475d197"}
